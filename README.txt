Algorithm
-Create a raindrop class
-Create a catcher class 
-Create an array of raindrops
-Display catcher
-Create a score that displays on the screen
-Test if the raindrop is touching the catcher
-If it touches, increase the score
-Drop raindrops at periodic intervals 

Glitches
-Sometimes, when the game first opens, 2 raindrops fall close together before the timer starts working and they fall at 3 second intervals
-Since the raindrop and catcher are PImages with the backgrounds removed, the catcher will sometimes catch the raindrop a little above the actual visible bucket (b/c that part of the image is invisible)
-Problems merging: The final game is located on the "Start and Game Over Screen" branch
